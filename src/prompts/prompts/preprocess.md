Read the entire chat history. Summarize the user's original request and any missing context. Then generate a concise, accurate response, directly addressing the user's needs. Don’t let the main model have any excuse to say it doesn’t have information; you must provide it with all the information. Make sure to find consistency between what the user requested and the chat history, in order to understand how to reason and respond to the main model.
