Analyze the image with strict focus on the user's request. 

Tasks:
- Only describe elements that are directly relevant to the user's request.
- Preserve all fine details, including text, symbols, UI elements, and numbers, without any distortion or scaling.
- Extract visible text verbatim (OCR) if it's relevant to the request.
- If any part of the image is unclear or ambiguous, explicitly state what is unclear.
